Note: 
In the sixteenth century, the architect Andrea Palladio began work on the  "Villa La Rotunda," in Northern Italy. It is considered to be Palladio's master work, a summation of the ideas of one of the greatest architects in history. 

Palladio himself was inspired by Ancient Rome, and how the architecture of that age reflected society's values. So, on the stairways and pediments of the Villa La Rotunda, he placed sculptures that embodied the values and ideals of Italian society in the guise of figures from Classical mythology. Not only did Palladio reflect ideal values in the orientation of the building and its proportions, but he literally represented these values as sculptures on the building's facade.

Palladio's other great legacy was his book, *The Four Books of Architecture*. Two hundred years after his death, editions of the book were still being printed with a frontespiece depicting the maidens of Architecture paying homage to the "Queen of Virtue."

Albert Speer's German pavillion from the 1937 World's Fair

Note: 

Let's look at another example. This is the German Pavillion, designed by Albert Speer, for the 1937 World's Fair, representing Germany's fascist government. A pavillion has a very different purpose than a plan to protect farmland. It has functional purposes, but it also represents the values and ideals of the creators explicitly. We can assume that Speer was pretty deliberate in building this 500 foot tall imposing, agressive tower of might to convey a set of values the government stood for. It's a monument to oppression and power.

Note: 
21 years later, Egon Eiermann designed the World's Fair pavillion for the Federal Republic of Germany’s in 1958. It emphasizes horizontiality to suggest calm, lightness to imply gentleness, and transparency to evoke democracy. It was a statement to the world about the values of the new German government.

### Political and ethical ideas can be written into window frames and door handles.

#### Alain de Botton

de Botton, A. (2006). *The Architecture of Happiness*. New York: Vintage International. p.93

Note:
This isn't an unusual proposition, that created things reflected societal values. Designers and artists from the Ancient Romans to today craft ideal values into their creations. (Whether the men and women that lived out their lives under these symbolic ideals lived up to them is another question.)

![Woodcut of farmers in North Carolina working in the fields with birds aflight behind them](img/puritanfarmers.jpg)

[http://ushistoryimages.com](http://ushistoryimages.com/images/north-carolina-colony/fullsize/north-carolina-colony-2.jpg)

Note:
In 17th century New England, life was hard. The Puritans, who had fled from England to settle in the wilderness of America, were adapting to the farming techniques they had learned from the Native Americans who had lived for centuries on the land. Both groups continued to face the same challenges, however, including marauding blackbirds that would eat seeds, shoots, leaves, fruit, and anything they could get their beaks on. The blackbirds appeared in such numbers that they could destroy acres of crops in just a day or two.

Both the Puritans and the Native Americans designed solutions to address the growing blackbird problem. The Native Americans institutionalized the natural deterents they knew worked on blakbirds. They posted children in the fields and in watchtowers to frighten away the birds. They tamed hawks that they tied near the fields, with the ropes giving the hawks enough flight to catch brave blackbirds who dared to attack the crops. Te whole community pitched in to deter the pests and protect the fields.

The Puritans also brought the community into the solution they designed, but they did it in their own way. The General Court of Massachussets passed an ordinance requiring every citizen to kill at least 10 blackbirds and 2 crows a year. These were minimums, of course. You were encouraged to kill as many as you could. 

How did these two groups come up ith such radically different approaches to the same problem?

### Technology is a branch of moral philosophy, not of science.

#### Paul Goodman

[Goodman, P. (1969). Can Technology Be Humane? *New York Review of Books*, Nov. 20, 1969](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1969/11/20/can-technology-be-humane)

Note:
The late social critic Paul Goodman wrote about technology in the broadest sense of "knowledge applied to practical ends," in other words, design. Design solutions, designed services, designed products and tools. And creating those things, he argued, involved moral choices first and foremost. Because as we create new things, we are shaping the kinds of experiences, and therefore the kinds of choices and lives, that users of our designs will face.

Neither the Puritans nor the Native Americans were trying very hard to be innovative here. To the best of our knowledge, no one held an ideation session with post it notes in a moldering wig wam or drafty shack in Eastern Massachussets. These solutions to a problem were designed based on each groups most closely held values. Those values were never explicitly examined or questioned, and the soutions were not examined for potentially disasterous consequences.

### System design reflects the designer's values and the cultural context.

Note:
 In his insightful talk Architecture is Politics, UX Libs alum Andreas Orphanides notes that nearly all created and designed things embed within them the values and biases or theior creators, whether we intend to or not. We're building systems that reflect our values, that inherently take stances about what is right and what is wrong.

[Inadvertent Algorithmic Cruelty, by Eric Meyer](http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2014/12/24/inadvertent-algorithmic-cruelty/)

Note:
In 2014, Facebook designers launched a new feature called Year in Review. They chose the image that had the most interactions on your timeline that year and presented it to you as the cover of a slideshow, highlighting what an awesome year you've had. 

In the summer of 2014 Eric Meyer lost his 6-year-old daughter to cancer. At the end of that year Facebook offered to show him his year with images of clip art party goers dancing around the face of his daughter.

![Montana State University Library's Student Personas](img/montanapersona1.png)

[Montana State Univesity Library: Design Research &gt; Personas](https://lib.montana.edu/design-research/personas)

Note:
Who are we designing for? A lot of us use personas in our work. Think of personas like trading cards, where each card represents some type of user, like "undergraduate students majoring in science" or "parents of small children." The persona will have a summary of typical goals for that group of users and a choice quote that helps you summarize user needs, as well as an identity created to help you understand the demographics you are designing for. 

These are some of the personas from Montana State University Library. They've done a really great job of documenting how they made these personas and how they use them.

They're all smiling. The images that were chosen for these people are all happy images. Even the adjunct professor is smiling, even though he's making less than a barista at Starbucks!

Are our users are super happy to be in the library? Are they all having terrific lives, and nothing is going to affect the work they do in our spaces, with our services or tools?

Note:
Just so that you don't think I'm being too hard on Montana State, here are the smiling users on the personas I made for GVSU three years ago.

Look around at personas. And not jst in libraries - everywhere. Personas are all smiling! Even when a user story isn't all happy (like the acknowledgment in Montana's adjunct persona that his contract is unpredictable) the user is smiling.

This can subtly affect how you think of the users you are designing for.
