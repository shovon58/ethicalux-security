Note: 
In the sixteenth century, the architect Andrea Palladio began work on the  "Villa La Rotunda," in Northern Italy. It is considered to be Palladio's master work, a summation of the ideas of one of the greatest architects in history. 

Palladio himself was inspired by Ancient Rome, and how the architecture of that age reflected society's values. So, on the stairways and pediments of the Villa La Rotunda, he placed sculptures that embodied the values and ideals of Italian society in the guise of figures from Classical mythology. Not only did Palladio reflect ideal values in the orientation of the building and its proportions, but he literally represented these values as sculptures on the building's facade.

Note:
Palladio's other great legacy was his book, *The Four Books of Architecture*. Two hundred years after his death, editions of the book were still being printed with a frontespiece depicting the maidens of Architecture paying homage to the "Queen of Virtue."

### Political and ethical ideas can be written into window frames and door handles.

#### Alain de Botton

de Botton, A. (2006). *The Architecture of Happiness*. New York: Vintage International. p.93

Note:
This wasn't an unusual proposition, that created things reflected societal values. Architects and artists from the Ancient Romans on through Palladio and his heirs intentionally crafted their ideal values into their creations. (Whether the men and women that lived out their lives under these symbolic ideals lived up to them is another question.)

Egon Eiermann's Federal Republic of Germany pavillion for the 1958 World's Fair

Note: 
21 years later, the Federal Republic of Germany’s 1958 world’s fair pavillion designed by Egon Eiermann. de Botton: “horizontiality to suggest calm, lightness to imply gentleness, ans transparency to evoke democracy.”

Not literal representations of the values in the form of gods or statues or frescos, but potent representations of the values of those who created them nonetheless.

### System design reflects the designer's values and the cultural context.

Note:
This is true of all created things, not just architecture. In his insightful talk TK, UX Libs II alum Andreas Orphanides notes that nearly all created and designed things are systems, and systems are just models of reality. When we create any model of reality, TK
